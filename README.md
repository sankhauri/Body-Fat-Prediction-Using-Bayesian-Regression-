# Predictive Model for Housing Price-
In this project we will apply linear regression models to predict the housing prices in Boston suburbs. The original data have been taken from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases at http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html. The data set is clean.
The report is organized in such a way as to demonstrate the entire process right from the beginning to exploratory analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution and importance of various features, finding a suitable model, training model, evaluation of the model, etc.
The main objective of the project is to fit a linear regression model which can predict the housing price with very small error.

## Data Description:
The Boston Housing Data Set has 14 variables. Out of them only chas is considered categorical. Our main objective is to predict medv which is the Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s against other variables. The full description can be found below.

CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town, ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft, INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town, CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise), NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million), RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling, AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940, DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways, TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town, B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)², where Bk is the proportion of [people of African American descent] by town, LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population, MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
